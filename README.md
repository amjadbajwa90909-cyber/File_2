# Scientific Calculator

This is a **scientific calculator** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The calculator includes basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), as well as advanced functions like sine, cosine, tangent, square roots, and more.

## Features

- **Basic arithmetic operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Advanced scientific operations**: Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan), square roots, exponentiation, and more.
- **Interactive UI**: Buttons that allow users to perform calculations directly.
- **Responsive design**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes for mobile and desktop use.
- **Light/Dark mode**: Switch between light and dark themes for better accessibility.
- **History memory**: Keeps track of the past calculations.

## How It Works

- **HTML**: Structures the layout and user interface with buttons for each calculation type.
- **CSS**: Styles the interface, including a toggle for dark/light modes and animated transitions.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the logic behind all the calculations and interactions (button clicks, input parsing, etc.).
